            <p><b>Why We Created the Split Bill Web-App</b></p>

            <p>Have you ever found yourself in a restaurant with friends, spending what feels like forever trying to 
                figure out who owes what? That's exactly where our story begins. 
            </p>
                
            <p>After a delightful dinner with friends,
                 we faced the daunting task of splitting the bill. With shared platters on the table and diverse dietary
                  needs in the mix â€“ from vegan to lactose intolerant, and some avoiding alcohol â€“ 
                  the challenge was real.
            </p>

            <p>That's when the idea struck us. Why not create a solution that makes life easier? And so, our Split Bill 
                Web-App was born. It's more than just an app; it's our way of turning a common social dilemma into a 
                quick, fair, and hassle-free experience.
            </p>

            <p>
            Now, everyone pays only for what they enjoy, and the joy of 
                dining together remains unspoiled by the bill that follows.
            </p>

                Enjoy!ðŸ˜„
